Knife Filter
================================
A Chrome extension that removes hot videos from YouTube suggestions, such as:

"GLOWING 1000 DEGREE KNIFE CUTS XYZ"   
"GLOWING 1000 DEGREE BALL MELTS XYZ"   

... and any video that contains the words "1000 degree".

Overview
--------------------------
In a culture fueled by clickbait, some people have gone a step further,
and creating a lot of useless videos made for the general masses, gathering
millions of dollars of revenue based on nothing, but a piece of metal that is
hot.

on by accident.
